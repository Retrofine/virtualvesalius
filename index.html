      <b>Virtual Vesalius</b> is a medical education venture that seeks to bring stereoscopic-3D 
      virtual and augmented reality experiences to the smartphones of anatomy students, worldwide. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to democratize the promise of mixed reality educational experiences to anyone with a smartphone in their pocket. Our plan is to use the Google Cardboard platform, an open-source inexpensive device that allows users to slide their phone inside a cardboard headset to see in true stereoscopic 3D.

    <h3 class="About us">About us.</h3>
    
    We are Nick Maizlin and Rohit Malyala, medical students at Western University and the University of British Columbia. Our experiences in delivering and receiving anatomy education during COVID lockdowns helped us realize the importance of having options for high-quality anatomy education even when access to physical models was not possible.

                Rohit Malyala is a medical student at the University of British Columbia. He first found a foothold in tech through game development and computer generated art. During his undergraduate and medical studies, he saw a role for digital art in improving anatomy education, developing a thesis in creating and assessing the use of stereopsis in virtual reality media in anatomy education, and later experimenting with computer vision applications in medical education.
