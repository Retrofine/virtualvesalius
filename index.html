      <b>Virtual Vesalius</b> is a medical education venture that seeks to bring stereoscopic-3D 
      virtual and augmented reality experiences to the smartphones of anatomy students, worldwide. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to democratize the promise of mixed reality educational experiences to anyone with a smartphone in their pocket. Our plan is to use the Google Cardboard platform, an open-source inexpensive device that allows users to slide their phone inside a cardboard headset to see in true stereoscopic 3D.

    <h3 class="About us">About us.</h3>
    
    We are Nick Maizlin and Rohit Malyala, medical students 
    at Western University and the University of British Columbia.
    Our experiences in delivering and receiving anatomy education 
    during COVID lockdowns helped us realize the importance of 
    having options for high-quality anatomy education even when access 
    to physical models was not possible.

                Rohit Malyala is currently a student at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine. He first found his way into technology through game development and digital art, and quickly realized the relevance of these skills in his medical studies, developing virtual reality educational experiences for anatomy education during his undergrad at McMaster University. In his spare time, he is an avid powerlifter and specialty coffee enthusiast.
