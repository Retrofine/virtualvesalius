  Some of our most complex work yet! This particular project is still in the development phase. Come back soon for more updates and a demo!

3D stereoscopic Basset slides are a collection of open-source, high-resolution images of human anatomy. These images contain an incredible level of detail and accuracy, making them an invaluable resource for medical professionals, students, and researchers.

They are a collection of 2D images that were captured using a technique called side-by-side (SBS) stereoscopy, which involves taking two images of an object from slightly different angles, and then combining them to create a 3D image that can be viewed using specialized glasses or a virtual reality device. This allows the user to gain a better understanding of the human anatomy and its structures.

One of the most exciting applications of these 3D stereoscopic Basset slides is the ability to use them with Google Cardboard or other virtual reality devices. By viewing the images in 3D, users can gain a deeper understanding of human anatomy and see structures in a way that is not possible with traditional 2D images. This can be particularly beneficial for medical professionals, who can use the images to better understand the relationships between different structures and plan surgeries more effectively.

McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada has been at the forefront of utilizing the Basset Slide Collection in virtual reality. Their first app, called VRBR (Virtual Reality Bellringer) uses Google Cardboard headsets to view the Basset slides, testing it with anatomy undergrads and medical students. The results have been promising, as it allowed students to gain a better understanding of human anatomy and improve their ability to diagnose and treat patients. They were able to improve on the slides collection by adding labels and annotations to the images as well.

In conclusion, the 3D stereoscopic Basset slides collection is a valuable resource for anyone working in the medical field. With the ability to view these images in 3D using Google Cardboard or other virtual reality devices, users can gain a deeper understanding of human anatomy and improve their ability to diagnose and treat patients. The fact that the collection is open-source makes it an accessible resource for anyone, regardless of their level of expertise or access to technology.
