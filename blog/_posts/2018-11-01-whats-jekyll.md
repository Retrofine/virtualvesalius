title: The VR Volume Renderer
---


[ViVRe](https://github.com/malyalar/vr-volume-renderer) is a Unity application designed for the creation and delivery of volume-rendered VR learning objects, sourced from 3D medical imaging data.

This repository allows a user to build an app that acts as a "volume renderer," software that renders a CT Scan or MRI in 3D, on android phones. Once built, the user can put their phone in a Google Cardboard 3D viewer and "slice" and rotate the model as desired. This is open source and be used by any institution that wishes to inexpensively allow students to study three-dimensional radiographs and complex anatomy slices.

It's a basic but powerful tool for understanding the inside of CT and MRI volumes in stereoscopic 3D.
