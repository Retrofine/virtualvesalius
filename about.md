      Our work has been featured in the <a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.S1.00384">FASEB Journal</a>, and <a href="https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/pain-institute/news-events/news-article/2018/09/12/mcmaster-creates-virtual-reality-anatomy-app-that-combines-old-and-new-technologies">associated projects</a> have been undertaken at major universities.

Stereoscopy, or stereoscopic imagery, uses the characteristics of human binocular vision to create the perception of depth, making objects appear to be in front of or behind the screen. The technique relies on presenting the right and left eyes with
two slightly different images which the brain automatically blends into a single view.

Stereopsis is an important distinguishing element of visual educational media that has a <b>significant [positive effect](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/medu.14352) on acquisition of anatomical knowledge</b>. But the cost of true-VR headsets still presents a barrier to uptake in anatomy labs. That's why we're focused on the highly-accessible Google Cardboard platform, an inexpensive headset that leverages smartphones to deliver true-stereo 3D visuals.

Take a peek below for some samples of prior work and future offerings:

* [Virtual Anatomist](https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1096/fasebj.2021.35.S1.00384), a totally-unique early-stage app that adds augmented-reality labels to existing anatomical models using computer vision.
* [ViVRe](https://github.com/malyalar/vr-volume-renderer), a Unity-based volume renderer that takes CT/MRI DICOMs and allows them to be rotated and sliced in performant, mobile-virtual reality
* [The Stereo Anatomy Reference](https://github.com/malyalar/stereo-anatomy-reference), an artistic and technical guideline/whitepaper for those interested in building stereoscopic VR anatomy educational media of their own.
